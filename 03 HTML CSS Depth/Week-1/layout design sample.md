# Layout Design

As you build web pages throughout your career, youâ€™ll notice that many pages follow similar layouts and structures. This is the outcome of many years of research into user interface design and user experience. Different companies, libraries and frameworks then adopt the resulting best practices.

Many examples of these layouts can be seen in the popular bootstrap framework. However, many other frameworks provide similar designs.

## Top Navbar Layout

Websites often have a top navbar layout to provide a set of essential anchor links to the user. These typically link to the main areas of the website, such as product pages, careers pages or contact pages. This provides the visitor to the website with a consistent navigation experience.

## Carousel Layout

Product-focused websites often use a large carousel on their homepage to highlight their featured products, discounts and offers. The carousel contains content items that will rotate through the carousel area at a fixed interval.
