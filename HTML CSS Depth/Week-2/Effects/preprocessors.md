# Preprocessors: Sass, SCSS, Stylus

Now that you've explored different animation effects, let's delve into preprocessors that can simplify the process of creating them. CSS preprocessors are specialized compilers used to generate a CSS file referenced by an HTML document. They aim to reduce the amount of CSS code, enhance code organization, and facilitate code reuse. Preprocessors extend the capabilities of CSS, offering features like variables, loops, and conditional statements. Some widely used preprocessors include Sass, LESS, Stylus, and PostCSS. The installation of a compiler on your web server is required to use these preprocessors.

In the early days of CSS, code management was challenging due to its length, complexity, and lack of structure. Preprocessors introduce scripting languages that add logical structures, automation properties, and code reusability. Let's explore two prominent preprocessors: Sass and SCSS.

## Sass and SCSS

**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)** is a scripting language that compiles into CSS. **SCSS (Sassy CSS)** is the syntax for Sass, serving as an advanced version of both Sass and CSS. The main difference lies in their syntax.

### Regular CSS
```css
body { 
    font: 100% Arial; 
    color: lightblue; 
}
```

### SCSS
```scss
$font-stack: Arial; 
$primary-color: lightblue; 

body { 
  font: 100% $font-stack; 
  color: $primary-color; 
}
```

### Sass
```sass
$font-stack: Arial 
$primary-color: lightblue 

body 
  font: 100% $font-stack 
  color: $primary-color 
```

In both SCSS and Sass examples, variables are defined at the top, enhancing code modularity and reusability. SCSS maintains the CSS syntax with curly brackets, while Sass uses indentation for nesting and omits brackets and semicolons.

These preprocessors support math and other functions, enabling conditional rule application. Key functionalities in Sass include directives like `@mixin` and `@include`.

#### Directives: @mixin and @include
```scss
@mixin some-rules { 
    color: lightblue; 
    font-size: 25px; 
    font-weight: bold; 
}

div { 
    @include some-rules; 
}
```

Here, `@mixin` defines a set of rules, and `@include` applies those rules to a selector.

Other directives like `@import` and `@extend` allow importing rules from another file and incorporating all rules from one selector into another, respectively.

## Stylus CSS

Stylus is another preprocessor that simplifies code without the need for colons, brackets, or semicolons. While these elements can still be used, Stylus allows for a more concise syntax.

```stylus
body 
  font 100% Arial 
  color lightblue 
```

The simplicity of Stylus code is evident, and it supports the use of colons, brackets, and semicolons without errors.

Functions in preprocessors are blocks of self-contained code, adding functionality beyond conventional CSS. Here's an example using Stylus:

```stylus
add(a, b) 
  a + b 

div 
  margin add(10px, 20px)
```

This code defines a function `add` and uses it to calculate the margin value.

Preprocessors offer various features, and the space of CSS preprocessors is competitive. Once you're comfortable with regular CSS, exploring preprocessors becomes essential due to their advanced features. The use of preprocessors is almost unavoidable in modern web development, given their capabilities beyond traditional CSS.
