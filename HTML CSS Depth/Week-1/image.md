# Understanding Images in Web Development

In web development, the `<img>` tag is used to embed images in webpages. Here's how you can utilize this tag effectively:

## Image Embedding Basics

The `<img>` tag allows you to add an image to a webpage. Specify the image's source using the `src` attribute:
```html
<img src="photo.png">
```

You can also set the width and height of the image using the `width` and `height` attributes:
```html
<img src="photo.png" width="640" height="480">
```

## Resizing Images

You can resize images, and the web browser will automatically scale them:
```html
<img src="photo.png" width="320" height="240">
```

To maintain the correct aspect ratio, set only the width or height, and the browser will calculate the other dimension:
```html
<img src="photo.png" width="320">
```

## Handling Image Loading Failures

Use the `alt` attribute to display text if the image fails to load:
```html
<img src="photo.png" width="320" alt="My Profile Photo">
```

## Enhancing Accessibility

For accessibility, combine the `<img>` tag with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags. Describe the image within the `<figcaption>` tag:
```html
<figure> 
   <img src="photo.png" width="320" alt="My Profile Photo"> 
   <figcaption>A photo of myself on a beach in 2015</figcaption> 
</figure>
```

## Supported Image File Types

Web browsers support specific image file types:
- .APNG – Animated Portable Network Graphics
- .AVIF – AV1 Image Format
- .GIF – Graphics Interchange Format
- .JPEG / .JPG – Joint Photographic Expert Group image format
- .PNG – Portable Network Graphics
- .SVG – Scalable Vector Graphics

Remember, using proper image techniques and ensuring accessibility will enhance the user experience on your websites.
